Usage:
```
>> defect(U, [, METHOD [, SV_TOLERANCE]])
>> defect(U)
>> defect(U, 'R')
>> defect(U, 'S')
>> defect(U, 'S', 1e-12)
>> defect(U, 'T')
>> defect(U, 'R', 1e-12)
>> defect(U, 'T', 1e-12)
```

The main script `defect.m` comprises of several other auxiliary scripts which can be used independently. They are:
- `defect_u.m` - defect of a unitary matrix
- `defect_h.m` - defect of a unitary matrix subjected to additional constraints.
